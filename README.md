# A Just-In-Time Framework for Routing-Oriented Traffic Prediction

This is the implement of Just-In-Time Framework. The overview of the framework is as follows:

<img src="framework.jpg" width="60%">

**[Step 1]** The *Search Space Estimation* model is utilized to estimate the search space. Meanwhile, the [*TTCk‚ÅøSP*](https://github.com/edenjing/TTCKnSP) algorithm is used to compute candidate paths. This step __reduces the prediction regions spatially__ from the entire graph to a smaller set.

**[Step 2]** The *Region-based Traffic Prediction Trigger Condition* is applied to assess the validity of speed profiles within each region, thereby identifying regions requiring updates. This step further __reduces the prediction region temporally__ to only very few outdated ones.

**[Step 3]** The *Region-based Traffic Prediction* process generates the latest speed profiles within these regions.

**[Step 4]** Retrieve affected ongoing queries that have not reached their destination in the speed profile updated regions.

**[Step 5]** Perform the re-routing of affected queries and output the latest optimal paths for them.

**[Step 6]** Perform the above steps for next coming query.
